# Human Computer Interaction Group Presentation

> The aim of this project is to conduct research in order to **gain empathy for people who face difficulty completing a task with an existing digital product**.

This project involves researching and analysing a website or app which provides a poor user experience. The primary focus is developing personas and empathy maps. These are then used to provide improvement suggestions for the site/app.
